Bayesian Charge Assigner and accompanying example notebook show how to use Bayesian Optimization via Gaussian Processes to assign Mn2+, Mn3+, and Mn4+ charge states onto DFT-SCAN structures using d-orbital moments.

SparseGroupLasso is used to enforce sparsity at the group-level (setting ECI to entire groups to 0 following the soft thresholding operator described by Simon, Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 2011.
